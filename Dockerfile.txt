# Dockerfile for integrating AdvancedTokenization into OSS-Fuzz

FROM gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-builder

WORKDIR /src

# Copy all project files into the container
COPY . .

# Run the build script to compile the fuzz target
RUN ./build.sh

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To run the fuzz target interactively (for testing), you can use:
#
#   ./out/advanced_fuzz_target -max_len=4096 -runs=1000
#
# This command limits the maximum input length to 4096 bytes and executes 1000 runs.
#
# To reproduce a specific crash, assuming a crash file was generated (e.g., crash-<hash>),
# run:
#
#   ./out/advanced_fuzz_target < crash-<hash>
#
# This feeds the crash input back into the fuzz target to reproduce the failure.
